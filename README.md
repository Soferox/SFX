What is Soferox?
-----------------

Simply put, Soferox is a decentralized network such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, NEM, or even Stratis. We are not utilizing old fashion methods such as Proof of Work, like Bitcoin, or Proof of Stake like Ethereum. Soferox uses a new, innovative way to secure blocks called Proof of Pact.

Soferox is indeed a cryptrocurrency and our Coin is called SFX. To send SFX from one account to another usually takes 1-10 seconds. After being mined successfully in about 2 minutes the transaction will be seen as immutable in the transaction chain.

Upcoming Features
-----------------
*Dual Chain wallets allowing the use of traditional crypto for those who want it, and new age for those ready
*PoP Consensus Algo
*C# Contract Publishing
*All C# built wallet in VS. Making debugging and open source work SO much easier
*Can be used with traditional chain effortless
*Large support langauge of C#
